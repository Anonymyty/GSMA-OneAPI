GSMA OneAPI Sandbox Server

Author: Stephen Doyle, Mobile Life
Repository admin: Kevin Smith, Vodafone

Purpose: The OneAPI sandbox server is an open source implementation of the GSMA OneAPI specification for accessing mobile network functions from the Web. The functions available are:

- Sending and receiving SMS and MMS from your Web application
- Locating mobile users via their phones
- charging a user's bill for Web content (e.g. an in-game micropayment)

Master and branches:
The master branch implements the GSMA OneAPI v1.0 specification.

The oneapi-2-0-beta branch will include the 1.0 APIs plus new APIs for Voice Call Control, Data Connection Profile, and Device Capability.

The oneapi-2-1-beta branch implements some changes on the location, messaging and payments APIs, primarily to allow asynchronous requests and callbacks. 

Usage: Full guide coming soonâ€¦for the Java sandbox, bundle the java/oneapi folder as  a WAR and it runs by default on port 8080. Tested on Tomcat 6 (OS X and Win XP)
